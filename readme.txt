== Description ==

This is the first step in a long journey, my first release of tools that easily take care of non-sense dirty work on fresh Wordpress installs.

It currently just globally removes the grey admin bar for logged in users, which I found myself doing on every fresh install. 

== Installation ==

1. Unzip and upload resulting directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
